  \begin{definition}
    A category $\E$ is an Elementary Higher Topos if it satisfies all of the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item it has finite limits and colimits \joseph{it's probably the case that only one of these is needed, but that hasn't been proven yet)
      \item it has a subobject classifier (object denoted \Omega_\E representing the functor $Sub(\bullet)$)
      \item it is locally cartesian closed (all slice cats are cartesian closed
	\item  every map is contained in some closed class $S$  of morphisms which is classified by some $\U^S\in \E$.
    \end{enumerate}
